Personalized Stat Tracker for VALORANT

## Overview
vtrack is a custom-built stat tracking application for VALORANT, designed to help analyze gameplay performance. This project serves as a learning experience in API requests, statistical logic, and UI design using Python.

## Features
- Fetch VALORANT match data via API requests
- Analyze session-based statistics (accuracy, headshot % deviation, etc.)
- Simple and intuitive UI for data visualization

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (for API requests and data processing)
- **Requests** (for fetching match data)
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** (for visualization) *(Planned)*
- **Tkinter/PyQt** (for UI design) *(Planned)*

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/xerosf/vtrack.git
   cd vtrack
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

## Roadmap
- [ ] Implement API integration for match history
- [ ] Develop core stat tracking logic
- [ ] Design an interactive UI
- [ ] Add advanced analytics (e.g., heatmaps, trend graphs)
